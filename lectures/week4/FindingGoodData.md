Consider if the data can answer your research questions

## Quality

Check for completeness and accuracy
Look for datasets with minimal missing values or errors

## Size

Ensure sufficient data for meaningful analysis
Consider computational resources required for large datasets

## Recency

Use up-to-date data when possible
Consider if historical data is appropriate for your project

## Format

Prefer structured formats like CSV for easy processing
Ensure compatibility with your tools and libraries

## Variety

Include diverse features for richer analysis
Consider combining multiple datasets if necessary

## Ethical Considerations

Ensure data was ethically collected and shared
Be aware of potential biases in the data

## License and Usage Rights

Check if the dataset is freely available for your intended use
Be aware of any attribution requirements

## Documentation

Look for well-documented datasets with clear feature descriptions
Understanding the data collection process can be valuable

## Preprocessing Requirements

Consider the amount of cleaning and preprocessing required
Balance between raw data and preprocessed data based on learning objectives
